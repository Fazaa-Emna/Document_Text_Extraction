# üìù **Intelligent Legal Document Parsing for French Text**

---

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
This project is dedicated to building an intelligent pipeline for parsing and extracting information from legal French documents. Legal documents often come with complex layouts and language, making accurate data extraction a challenging task. Our solution integrates state-of-the-art technologies to tackle this challenge, ensuring high accuracy in text extraction, structure, and summarization.

The pipeline is divided into three main notebooks, each addressing a critical stage of the document parsing workflow.

  1. **OCR Extraction**:
     - Extract text using **PaddleOCR** for robust multi-language support.
  2. **Post-OCR Text Cleaning**:
     - Normalize text.
     - Correct OCR errors (e.g., spelling mistakes, punctuation issues) using **Hunspell** (French spell checker).
     - Ensure consistent formatting.
  3. **NER and POS Tagging**:
     - Apply **SpaCy** for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging to enrich the extracted data.
  4. **Summarization and Structuring**:
     - Leverage **Falcon-7B-Instruct**, a powerful LLM, to summarize and structure cleaned text into JSON format.
- **Technologies**:
  - üìñ **PaddleOCR**: OCR engine for French legal text.
  - üî§ **Hunspell**: French spelling correction.
  - üß† **SpaCy**: NER and POS tagging.
  - ü§ñ **Falcon-7B-Instruct**: Summarization and structuring via state-of-the-art LLMs.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Notebook 3: Fine-Tuning YOLOv9 for Hand Signature Detection**
- **Goal**: Train a custom YOLOv9 model to detect hand signatures in scanned complaint documents.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Dataset Preparation**:
    - Collected and labeled a dataset of **1950 images** containing hand signatures using **Roboflow**.
    - Applied **data augmentation** to simulate real-world scanned conditions:
      - **Scaling**, **rotation**, **shearing**, **grayscale conversion**, **blur**, and **noise addition**.
    - Final dataset size after augmentation: **4980 images**, split into:
      - **Training Set**: 4545 images (91%)
      - **Validation Set**: 184 images (4%)
      - **Test Set**: 251 images (5%).
    - [View the collected dataset on Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/smart-conseil-lvw6i/signature_detector/browse?queryText=&pageSize=50&startingIndex=0&browseQuery=true).
  - **Model Fine-Tuning**:
    - Fine-tuned the YOLOv9 model on this dataset to detect hand signatures.
    - Optimized hyperparameters to achieve high precision and recall.
  - **Evaluation**:
    - The model was evaluated on metrics such as **mAP@0.5** (90%+) and **mAP@0.5:0.95** (80%).
    - Demonstrated robustness in detecting signatures under various conditions, including complex document layouts.

- **Technologies**:
  - ‚öôÔ∏è **YOLOv9**: Object detection model for hand signature identification.
  - üñºÔ∏è **Roboflow**: Dataset preparation and augmentation.
  - üìä **Matplotlib**: Visualization of training metrics and evaluation results.
